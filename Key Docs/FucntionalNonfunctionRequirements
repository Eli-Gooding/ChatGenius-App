### Performance
1. Real-time messaging latency must not exceed 200ms under normal load.  
2. The application should handle 1,000 concurrent users per channel without performance degradation.  
3. API response times must average below 500ms for 95% of requests.

### Scalability
1. The backend must scale horizontally to support up to 100,000 active users.  
2. Ensure file uploads and storage are optimized for growth, with a scalable solution like AWS S3.

2. Provide an intuitive UI with minimal learning curve, adhering to established design patterns.  
3. Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 Level AA), including keyboard navigation and screen reader support.  

### Maintainability
1. Codebase must be modular and follow SOLID principles for ease of maintenance and updates.  
2. Write unit tests covering 90% of critical functionality and integration tests for key workflows.
